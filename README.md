# notetaker

deployed application: https://intense-taiga-00664.herokuapp.com/

github repository: https://github.com/Brycetp11/notetaker

Description: In this app we allow a user to write a note with a title, and description. These individual notes are saved, and recalled for the user by persisting in an api. We use the get, post, and delete methods to manipulate the notes that exist.
